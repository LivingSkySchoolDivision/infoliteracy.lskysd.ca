  <p><img src="../../../files/u2/curiosity1.jpg" alt="girl and bubble" align="left" height="269" width="334" /><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">The key emphasis in inquiry-based learning is on student questioning. Faced with an authentic problem students begin with asking questions about the topic being studied. Students are guided through inquiry by asking:  <br /></font>
<ul>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">What do I already know?</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">What questions do I have?</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">How do I find out?</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">What did I learn?</font></li>
</ul>
</p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">These questions, gleaned from the students’ natural curiosity, guide the research process leading students to find information from which they create their own knowledge and understanding about the topic.  When students find answers to their own questions, their motivation and ownership is increased. Instructors act more as coaches, guides, and facilitators who help learners arrive at their &quot;true&quot; questions—the things they really care about.  </font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Middle years teachers in the Living Sky School Division are involved in a <a href="http://imaginethis.wikispaces.com/Inquiry+Learning">professional development working committee </a>in which they are using division supplied laptops to create inquiry-based units.  Teachers have been involved in learning about inquiry-based learning, new web-based technology tools and <a href="http://www.ubdexchange.org/">backwards design</a> .  Their finshed product will be a unit based on each of the four middle years ELA curricula which will be available to all teachers. </font> </p>
