  <p><em><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">The following examples of questions addressing each level are based on Doug Johnson&#39;s Good Questions hand-out from his </font><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">presentation handout,<a href="http://www.doug-johnson.com/pres.html#Research"> Designing Research Projects that Kids (and Teachers) Love</a></font></em><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><br /></font> </p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><strong>Level One Question</strong><br /> My research is about a broad topic. I can complete the assignment by using a general reference source such as an encyclopedia.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Example: My research is about the causes of the genocide in Rwanda.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><strong>Level Two Question</strong><br /> My research answers a question that helps me narrow the focus of my search. The question may mean that I need to go to various sources to gather enough information to get a reliable answer. The conclusion of the research will ask me to give a supported answer to the question.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Example: Why was Romeo Dallaire unable to inform the world about the genocide in Rwanda?</font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><strong>Level Three Question</strong><br /> My research answers a question of personal relevance. To answer this question I may need to consult not just secondary sources such as magazines, newspapers, books or the Internet, but use primary sources of information such as original surveys, interviews, or source documents.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Example: How did the atrocities of the Rwanda genocide affect Constable xxxx, of North Battleford, during and after his time as a member of the Canadian Peacekeeping forces in Rwanda?</font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><strong>Level Four Question</strong><br /> My research answers a personal question about the topic, and contains information that may be of use to decision-makers as they make policy or distribute funds. The result of my research is a well-supported conclusion that contains a call for action on the part of an organization or government body. There will be a plan to distribute this information.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">E</font><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">xample: The Genocide Convention defines genocide as &quot;acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethical, racial or religious group&quot;. Since the genocide in Rwanda ethic killings have taken place in Darfur in the Sudan. How might curricular and extra-curricular activities be utilized to motive students at NBCHS to lobby governments to take action and protect global citizens against such evil?</font></font></p>
