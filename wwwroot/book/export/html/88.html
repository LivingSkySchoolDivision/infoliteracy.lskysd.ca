</p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"> In an information and technology rich world it is easy for students to cut and paste the information they find for their fact-based assignments and projects. High School teacher-librarian, <a href="http://mciunix.mciu.k12.pa.us/%7Espjvweb/jvweb.html">Joyce Valenza</a> asks, with basic information so easy to access, shouldn&#39;t we now focus our students attention on questions that will challenge them to use information meaningfully - to think, analyze, evaluate and invent?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Before students can start to ask good questions they need to see it modeled by their teachers. <a href="http://www.edb.utexas.edu/pbl/tips/question.html">Tips for Teachers: Asking Good Questions</a>, provides some questioning strategies that provoking high-level thinking.  Jamie Mackenzie&#39;s  <a href="http://www.fno.org/nov97/toolkit.html">Questioning Toolkit</a> describes the many different types of questions that can be introduced as early as kindergarten to enable students to have powerful questioning technologies and techniques with them as they arrive in high school. </font></p>

  <p><em><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">The following examples of questions addressing each level are based on Doug Johnson&#39;s Good Questions hand-out from his </font><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">presentation handout,<a href="http://www.doug-johnson.com/pres.html#Research"> Designing Research Projects that Kids (and Teachers) Love</a></font></em><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><br /></font> </p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><strong>Level One Question</strong><br /> My research is about a broad topic. I can complete the assignment by using a general reference source such as an encyclopedia.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Example: My research is about the causes of the genocide in Rwanda.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><strong>Level Two Question</strong><br /> My research answers a question that helps me narrow the focus of my search. The question may mean that I need to go to various sources to gather enough information to get a reliable answer. The conclusion of the research will ask me to give a supported answer to the question.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Example: Why was Romeo Dallaire unable to inform the world about the genocide in Rwanda?</font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><strong>Level Three Question</strong><br /> My research answers a question of personal relevance. To answer this question I may need to consult not just secondary sources such as magazines, newspapers, books or the Internet, but use primary sources of information such as original surveys, interviews, or source documents.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Example: How did the atrocities of the Rwanda genocide affect Constable xxxx, of North Battleford, during and after his time as a member of the Canadian Peacekeeping forces in Rwanda?</font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><strong>Level Four Question</strong><br /> My research answers a personal question about the topic, and contains information that may be of use to decision-makers as they make policy or distribute funds. The result of my research is a well-supported conclusion that contains a call for action on the part of an organization or government body. There will be a plan to distribute this information.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">E</font><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">xample: The Genocide Convention defines genocide as &quot;acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethical, racial or religious group&quot;. Since the genocide in Rwanda ethic killings have taken place in Darfur in the Sudan. How might curricular and extra-curricular activities be utilized to motive students at NBCHS to lobby governments to take action and protect global citizens against such evil?</font></font></p>
