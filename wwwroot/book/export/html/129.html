<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><img src="../../../files/u2/pink.jpg" alt="A whole new mind - book cover" align="left" height="210" width="210" />A <a href="http://doug-johnson.squarespace.com/blue-skunk-blog/2005/8/22/a-whole-new-mind.html">post</a>  from Doug Johnson outlines <a href="http://www.danpink.com/aboutdp.php">Pink&#39;</a> s thesis in <a href="http://www.danpink.com/aboutwnm.php">A Whole New Mind</a>  and the necessary &#39;right-brain&#39; senses we need in what Pink calls the Conceptual Age. </font></p>
<blockquote><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Pink acknowledges the outsourcing trend (Asia), as well as two other trends he labels Abundance and Automation. He suggests that readers ask themselves three questions about their jobs:</font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"> 1. Can someone overseas do it cheaper?<br /> 2. Can a computer do it faster?<br /> 3. Am I offering something that satisfies the nonmaterial, transcendent desires of an abundant age? (Are you not just making toilet brushes, but toilet brushes that satisfy the user’s aesthetic sensibilities as well?)</font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"> As a result of these trends, he believes we are shifting from the Information Age to the Conceptual Age. Successful players in this new economy will increasing be required to develop and use the right-brain abilities of high concept (seeing the larger picture, synthesizing information) and high touch (being empathetic, creating meaning). Happy news, perhaps, for those of us who never were all that good at the left-brain stuff in the first place.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"> More specifically, he suggests we work toward developing in ourselves (and I hope by implication, our students), six right brain “senses,” to complement our left-brain, analytic skills. He suggests we will need realize the value of:</font></p>

And it’s not going to be between companies and companies. The greatest economic competition going forward is going to be between you and your own imagination. Your ability to act on your imagination is going to be so decisive in driving your future and the standard of living in your country. So the school, the state, the country that empowers, nurtures, enables imagination among its students and citizens, that’s who’s going to be the winner.&quot;</font></p></blockquote>
