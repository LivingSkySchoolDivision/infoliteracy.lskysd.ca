  <p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">The driving force behind problem-based learning is the ill-structured, messy problem matching the complexities of real life.  Problem-based learning stems from the belief that the purpose of education is to teach students to solve problems because the “non-school world (everyday life, business, hobbies, organizations) demands competent problem solvers”.  </font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Schools usually ask students to solve well-structured problems such as story problems, which require a finite number of concepts, rules, and principles to be applied to a constrained problem situation. In these situations students only grasp the surface elements of the problem and do not form a conceptual understanding of the problem.  Thus, they are unable to transfer their problem solving skills to other problems which are ill-structured, messy and with solutions that are not predictable and convergent The process in problem-based learning mirrors the learning process required of learners when they encounter problems in their lives and careers. </font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">The problems students are posed often lack clarity, do not have a set formula to follow, change with new information and have many different solutions that can be reached.  To solve the problem students need to accept uncertainty, make judgments and express personal opinions and beliefs.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Technology is a key component of problem-based learning, as students must have access to a wide variety of resources and the skills to be able to find, use and share the information necessary for solving an ill-structured problem.</font></p>
