  <p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Project-based learning (PBL) is a student-centered teaching and learning strategy which enables students to acquire new knowledge and skills in the course of designing, planning and creating a product or performance.</font></p>
<p> <font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Students are given a clearly stated problem that requires a specific set of conclusions or a solution that directly responds to the problem.  </font><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Real world connections are made through the application and integration of content from different subject areas during the production process.</font> </p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><a href="http://www.bie.org/index.php/site/PBL/pbl_handbook_introduction/#classroom">The Buck Institute for Education</a>  defines project-based learning as “ a systemic teaching method that engages students in learning knowledge and skills through an extended inquiry process structured around complex authentic questions and a carefully designed products and tasks”. Esch, (1998) outlines the production model steps which students following in project based learning: <br /></font></p>

<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Define a purpose for the end product and identify the audience</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Research, design and project plan</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Start project, resolve problems and issues that arise in production</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Use or present the project</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Reflect on and evaluate the process and the project</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">The production process and the end product in project-based learning engage students in doing rather than passively receiving knowledge thus allowing them to create their own knowledge.  </font></p>
