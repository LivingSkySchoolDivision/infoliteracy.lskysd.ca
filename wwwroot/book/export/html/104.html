As important as these skills are they cannot exist without a philosophical framework. T</font><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">he strands of information problem-solving cannot not be taught in isolation. First a teacher, a school or even a school division needs to decide on a framework for guiding the research; inquiry-based learning, project-based learning or problem-based learning.  The next step is to select one of the many problem-solving models available and then to  focus on the specific skills required to effectively find, use and share information. </font></div>

<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><font size="3">In</font></font><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"> Saskatchewan the concept of information literacy has been embedded in the <a href="http://www.sasklearning.gov.sk.ca/branches/curr/iru/rbl/index.shtml">Resource-based Learning</a>  approach and has become entrenched in the curriculum.</font><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"></font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Resource-based learning is a constructivist-learning environment where students become active participants in their own learning; collaborate with others to meet their learning needs, and through the use of a wide variety of resources piece together information to construct their own meaningful understanding about a subject.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"> </font><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><font size="3">Saskatchewan learning in its policy documents and in each of its curricula states that resource-based learning:</font><br /></font></p>
<ul>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">makes provisions for every student,</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">encourages students to be active learners,</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">allows students to vary the rate at which they learn,</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">encourages students to be creative, imaginative and curious---to become active rather than passive learners,</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">offers students and teachers the opportunity to choose the location in which to learn - the classroom, library or community,</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"> promotes acquisition of research skills, higher order thinking skills, communication skills.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Resource-based learning while offering a constructivist approach to education has been difficult to implement and over the past few years several manifestations have appeared which provide a practical framework for student research.  These include <a href="https://infoliteracy.lskysd.ca/pd/inquirybasedlearning">inquiry-based learning</a>, <a href="https://infoliteracy.lskysd.ca/pd/projectbasedlearning">project-based   learning</a>   and <a href="https://infoliteracy.lskysd.ca/pd/problembasedlearning">problem-based learning</a> .  Each of these approaches offers teachers a framework within which to structure student learning and once the framework is chosen an <a href="https://infoliteracy.lskysd.ca/pd/models">information problem-solving model</a>  can be selected.<a href="https://infoliteracy.lskysd.ca/pd/problem"> </a> </font></p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Inquiry Based Learning</h1>
  <p><img src="../../../files/u2/curiosity1.jpg" alt="girl and bubble" align="left" height="269" width="334" /><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">The key emphasis in inquiry-based learning is on student questioning. Faced with an authentic problem students begin with asking questions about the topic being studied. Students are guided through inquiry by asking:  <br /></font>
<ul>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">What do I already know?</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">What questions do I have?</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">How do I find out?</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">What did I learn?</font></li>
</ul>
</p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">These questions, gleaned from the students’ natural curiosity, guide the research process leading students to find information from which they create their own knowledge and understanding about the topic.  When students find answers to their own questions, their motivation and ownership is increased. Instructors act more as coaches, guides, and facilitators who help learners arrive at their &quot;true&quot; questions—the things they really care about.  </font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Middle years teachers in the Living Sky School Division are involved in a <a href="http://imaginethis.wikispaces.com/Inquiry+Learning">professional development working committee </a>in which they are using division supplied laptops to create inquiry-based units.  Teachers have been involved in learning about inquiry-based learning, new web-based technology tools and <a href="http://www.ubdexchange.org/">backwards design</a> .  Their finshed product will be a unit based on each of the four middle years ELA curricula which will be available to all teachers. </font> </p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Project Based Learning</h1>
  <p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Project-based learning (PBL) is a student-centered teaching and learning strategy which enables students to acquire new knowledge and skills in the course of designing, planning and creating a product or performance.</font></p>
<p> <font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Students are given a clearly stated problem that requires a specific set of conclusions or a solution that directly responds to the problem.  </font><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Real world connections are made through the application and integration of content from different subject areas during the production process.</font> </p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><a href="http://www.bie.org/index.php/site/PBL/pbl_handbook_introduction/#classroom">The Buck Institute for Education</a>  defines project-based learning as “ a systemic teaching method that engages students in learning knowledge and skills through an extended inquiry process structured around complex authentic questions and a carefully designed products and tasks”. Esch, (1998) outlines the production model steps which students following in project based learning: <br /></font></p>
<ol>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Define a purpose for the end product and identify the audience</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Research, design and project plan</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Start project, resolve problems and issues that arise in production</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Use or present the project</font></li>
<li><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Reflect on and evaluate the process and the project</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">The production process and the end product in project-based learning engage students in doing rather than passively receiving knowledge thus allowing them to create their own knowledge.  </font></p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Problem Based Learning</h1>
  <p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">The driving force behind problem-based learning is the ill-structured, messy problem matching the complexities of real life.  Problem-based learning stems from the belief that the purpose of education is to teach students to solve problems because the “non-school world (everyday life, business, hobbies, organizations) demands competent problem solvers”.  </font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Schools usually ask students to solve well-structured problems such as story problems, which require a finite number of concepts, rules, and principles to be applied to a constrained problem situation. In these situations students only grasp the surface elements of the problem and do not form a conceptual understanding of the problem.  Thus, they are unable to transfer their problem solving skills to other problems which are ill-structured, messy and with solutions that are not predictable and convergent The process in problem-based learning mirrors the learning process required of learners when they encounter problems in their lives and careers. </font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">The problems students are posed often lack clarity, do not have a set formula to follow, change with new information and have many different solutions that can be reached.  To solve the problem students need to accept uncertainty, make judgments and express personal opinions and beliefs.</font></p>
