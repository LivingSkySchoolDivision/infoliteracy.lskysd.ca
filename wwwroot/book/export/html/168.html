<blockquote>The Discovery Education Streaming Video Site is extremely informative but it also absolutely enhances students’ learning. Today I showed the video, Cells: The Basic Units of Life. It not only adequately covered most of the material in our Science Grade 7 core unit, Basics of Life, but the students really did enjoy the presentation. I’ve looked at many of the videos on this site, and can easily see how they can be effectively utilized to get students energized and engaged in hands-on learning experiences. Video is the perfect medium for students who are auditory or visual learners.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This website is very full of interesting things, and the movie we watched today was outstanding. It gave us great details of everything about our unit, and it is a great website to learn from. Thank you very much; I know my whole class will enjoy this website just as much as me. </blockquote>
